## HTML

##### what are html tags?

names of the specific html elements (they are contained in brackets).

---

##### what are html attributes?

html attributes are created for specific tag manipulation purposes. For example we have:

```html
<div>
  <h1 class="my-headline">Who We Are</h1>
  <h1>Life At Github</h1>
</div>
```

And for this html element the attribute is `class` we give him a value `my-headline` after which we are able to change current `h1` styles from CSS level, without affecting the other tag without the same class value.

---

##### what is the role of head and body?

We use EVERY time those elements!!!! (ONCE only in every .html file)
they both contain the most amount of elements, a code can work without them but it will look un professional and har to understand

---

##### what type of tags should be in body?

The visible part of the website, for example:
headings, texts, hyperlinks, banners, images, videos, contact forms, etc.:

---

##### what type of tags should be in head?

The part of website which is not visible for user, for example:
meta , link , title , style , script , noscript , and base
